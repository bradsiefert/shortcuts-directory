# Shortcuts Directory Readme

## Development Stack
This site uses [https://gridsome.org](Gridsome) which is a static site generator based on VueJS. I love it! Itâ€™s wonderful to work with. Itâ€™s pretty young, but hopefully itâ€™ll grow up strong over the coming years. 

Hereâ€™s an overview of the siteâ€™s development stack:

### Frontend 

1. Install Gridsome CLI `npm install --global @gridsome/cli` 
2. Clone this repository from Github.
3. Navigate to the projectâ€™s folder
3. Run `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

### Backend
1. The backend database is hosted at [https://airtable.com](Airtable), which is a no-code tool for creating spreadsheets and databases. The backend can be viewed here:  [Shortcuts Directory Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrgyzEaEUZDg2pim)
2. The data is imported into Gridsome using the plugin `@gridsome/source-airtable` plugin
3. Airtable has web request rate limits that make it not a bad option as a pure backend web server. This site, and the Gridsome/Airtable plugin, bake in the data whenever the site is built on the server. This makes it so the site is very quick because it doesnâ€™t have to request data from Airtableâ€™s servers.
4. Every time the data in Airtable changes, the site needs to be rebuilt to pull in the latest data. I do this by making a trivial change like adding a comment to the bottom of my `main.js` file.   


### Deployment and Hosting
This site is deployed and hosted at [https://netlify.com](Netlify). Every new push to the main branch of the repo creates a new build of the site. For more information, check out Netlifyâ€™s documentation.
